## EUPanda: a End-User Programming framework for the FRANKA Panda

_EUPanda_ is a End-User Programming framework for the FRANKA Panda Robot Arm that tries to replicate the proprietary Desk environment [1] in a open source ROS-based fashion.

The framework allows to create from kinestethic teaching robot programs made of 5 primitives (move to, move to contact, move fingers, apply force with fingers and an user synchronization primitive). Programs can be executed step-by-step or fully; Similarly, primitives can be reverted.

This is still Work In Progress! Contact me (Mattia Racca) for more information!
