# EUPanda: a End-User Programming framework for the FRANKA Panda

**EUPanda** is a End-User Programming framework for the FRANKA Panda Robot Arm that tries to replicate the proprietary
[Desk environment] in a open source ROS-based fashion.

The framework allows to create from kinestethic teaching robot programs made of 5 primitives:
* move to pose,
* move to contact at pose,
* move fingers,
* apply force with fingers, and
* user synchronization primitive.

Programs can be executed step-by-step or fully; Similarly, primitives can be reverted.

Watch [eupanda] in action!.

## Status

EUPanda development is **stale**:
* The backend (C++/Python) supports creation of programs, creation through kinesthetic teaching, and their execution (and reversion).
* The `master` branch has the GUI (PyQT) used for tuning of already created robot programs (see \[[1]\]).
* The `pbd_gui_development` branch integrates in the GUI the automatic creation of robot programs from unconstrained robot demonstrations (see  \[[2]\]).

For the Active Learning code behind our HRI'20 paper \[1\], please check the [tuning_al_gui] repository.
